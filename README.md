# IA51

# Stable version

## Already done but not in this repository:
- Human fleeing behaviour
- Zombie seeking behaviour

## To improve :
- GUI
- How to know if the GUI is closed ? At the moment, the test agent never stop

## Todo :
- A wandering behaviour less random / more natural for Zombies
- Create wall
- Create glass
- Create weapon (request from M.Galland)
- Create interaction between Zombie/Human and wall/glass/weapon

## How to launch the simulation :
Click on test.sarl -> run as -> sarl agent
